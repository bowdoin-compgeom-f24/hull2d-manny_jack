### Authors: Manuel Santiago, Jack Kinsella 
FROM TOMA:
____________________________
2d convex hull startup code.  
Should compile as is.
To do: Fill in the graham_scan function and create some initializers. 
____________________________

 
Figure out the details of graham_scan and handle degeneracies in input

## TODO:
- Create 2 sets of Points to compute hull
    - At least one set with colinear points
- Write initializer function and post to #projects channel (NOT GENERAL)
- Include 5 classmates test cases in code


1. what sort of inputs constitute degeneracies for the algorithm and how you handled these degeneracies

2. pictures of the two initializers you created & pictures of the other initializers you used

3. pictures of the convex hulls computed for each initial configuration of points — for all these choose a reasonable value of n

4. if your code does not work in all cases, explain

5. any extra features. 

6. Time you spent in: Thinking; Programming; Testing; Documenting; Total

7. Brief reflection prompts (you don’t need to address all): how challenging did you find this project? what did you learn by doing this project? What did you wish you did differently? If you worked as a team, how did that go? What would you like to explore further?
